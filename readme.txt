A WordPress widget that gives you unlimited control over showing posts.

== Description ==

The *Query Posts* widget was written to allow users that don't know their way around PHP to easily show posts in any way they'd like.  It's like having a cool WordPress developer as a friend ready to do your bidding.  Seriously.

The widget has nearly 40 options to choose from.  You can list posts by category, tag, author, date, time, name, or anything you can imagine.  You can choose to show the full content, excerpts, or even a simple list.  Oh, and you can even show pages.

This is the widget that keeps users out of the code and gives them the ability to display items on their site how they want.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `query-posts` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to <em>Appearance > Widgets</em> and place the <em>Query Posts</em> widget where you want.

More detailed instructions are included in the plugin's `readme.html` file.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why was this plugin created? =

End users sometimes want to do complicated things but don't nave the technical *know-how* of seasoned developers.  This creates a massive barrier between users that can have *really* cool sites and those that have to use what their theme developer gave them.

This plugin is about removing that barrier.

= How do I show thumbnails? =

This plugin integrates quite nicely with the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/get-the-image" title="Get the Image WordPress plugin">Get the Image</a> plugin.  If you've activated that plugin, you will have an additional checkbox to show thumbnails.  Thumbnails will not be shown if `list` is selected for `display`.

== How do I set it up? ==

There's not a lot of work you have to do.  Just add the widget to your theme's widget area(s).  If anything, you'll probably be overwhelmed by the myriad of options.  I've included a handy guide on what each option means with supplemental reading material.  Just check out the `readme.html` included with the plugin download.
